# Assignment 2

## Main file structure
* as_2_1.py 				- used to plot and calculate the wave spectra questions in problem 1 a)-c)
* ITTC_surface_elevation.m 	- used to simulate the wave spectra in problem 1 d)
* wind.m 					- used to calculate and simulate the questions in problem 2
* current.m 				- used to calculate and simulate the questions in problem 3

The surface elevation of the given ITTC spectra looks like this (up until the last second where something glitchy happens):
