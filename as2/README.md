# Assignment 2

## File structure
* as_2_1.py - used to plot and calculate the wave spectra questions in problem 1 a)-c)
* ITTC_surface_elevation.m - used to plot and simulate the wave spectra in problem 1 d)

Here, calculations with environmental modelling was done. E.g, the surface elevation of the given ITTC spectra looks like this (up until the last second where something glitchy happens):

* wind.m - used to calculate and simulate the questions in problem 2
